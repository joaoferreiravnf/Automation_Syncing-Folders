Folder Synchronization Tool

This program synchronizes two folders: source and replica. It ensures that the replica folder maintains a complete and identical copy of the source folder.

The key features include:

- Full Synchronization: The program performs a thorough synchronization to ensure all files and subdirectories in the source folder are replicated exactly in the replica folder.
- Automated Updates: Any changes in the source folder, such as additions, deletions, or modifications of files, are automatically mirrored in the replica folder.
- Efficient Copying: The synchronization process is optimized to copy only the necessary files, minimizing redundant operations.

This tool is useful for backup purposes, ensuring that you always have an up-to-date copy of your important files.
